"""Pure types and constants for the polling subsystem — leaf-level, no I/O.

This module exists so callers (notably ``window_tick.decide``) can depend on
the polling contract without loading the stateful singletons in
``polling_state``. F4's pure-decision-kernel invariant is enforced at the
import level by ``tests/ccgram/handlers/polling/test_polling_types_purity.py``:
importing this module must NOT execute ``polling_state`` top-level code.

Imports are restricted to stdlib + ``ccgram.providers.base.StatusUpdate`` plus
``TYPE_CHECKING``-only references to ``telegram.Bot`` and
``ccgram.screen_buffer.ScreenBuffer``. Anything else is a regression.
