"""Window ID resolution, format helpers, and startup migration.

Provides shared window ID helpers used across session, tmux_manager, and
handler modules (no intra-package imports — safe from circular dependencies):
  - is_window_id(): validate tmux window ID format (@0, @12).
  - resolve_stale_ids(): full startup recovery — remaps persisted window IDs
    against live tmux windows, handles old-format migration, prunes dead entries.
  - migrate_window_aliases(): per-cycle reconciliation — folds state persisted
    under a superseded window id (``WindowRef.alias_window_ids``) onto the id
    that identifies the same window now.
