"""Read-only window state queries — free functions for handler use.

Provides the same window-state read accessors as ``SessionManager`` but as
module-level free functions.  Handler modules that only need to *read* window
state can import from here instead of ``session``, reducing their coupling
surface from the full ``SessionManager`` singleton to a set of narrow query
functions that depend only on ``window_state_store`` and ``config``.

Write operations (``set_window_provider``, ``set_window_approval_mode``, etc.)
remain on ``SessionManager`` — only modules that genuinely mutate state should
import it.
